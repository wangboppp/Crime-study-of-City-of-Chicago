# Crime-study-of-City-of-Chicago

#I would like to propose a project of studying the crimes history (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) for #city of Chicago from 2001 and present. As we know, Chicago can be one of the most dangerous cities, particularly depends on the #neighborhoods. I have visited Chicago several times, and I like that fact that there are a lot of great food, famous museums, exciting #shows and the overall city is very beautify. People say that the north region of the city is quiet and safe, whereas the south region, #especially those regions pass University of Chicago can be very dangerous. But I donâ€™t think that potential criminal are active 24*7 in #these area, and there should be a pattern of what type of crime occurs at what time of the day, and which day of the week. Thus, in this #project, we will be analyzing the incidents of crime based on its type, its geological location in the city, and the time and day of the #week over more than 15 years. And hopefully we can conclude the nature of incidents of crime from the past, and predict the safety area #in city of Chicago of the time and date in order to help people decide their travel plan reasonably.
