# Crime-study-of-City-of-Chicago

The data is available on the data portal website of City of Chicago:

https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I will be using Tableau here to provide a brief analyse of several primary types of crimes and the related police station district from this data.
